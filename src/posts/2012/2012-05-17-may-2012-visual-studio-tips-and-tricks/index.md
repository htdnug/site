Date: May 17, 2012 Time: 6:00 pm – 8:00 pm Location: [Terrebonne Parish Library – North Branch](http://htdnug.wordpress.com/meetings/ "Meetings")

\*\* Due to scheduling conflicts at our venue, our next meeting will be held on the 17th of May.

During our kick off meeting, we discussed getting into theory (principles, patterns, practices, etc) and specific technology areas (WPF, Silverlight, SharePoint, etc). Before we do that, we’ve decided to do a session on Visual Studio. We’ll have demos prepared of our favorite tips and tricks but this will be an open topic and we’d like for all of our Visual Studio veterans to bring a few of their favorite tips and tricks as well.
