Topic: History of the Web and Why Even Javascript - So much of modern web programming only makes sense in the context of how we got here to begin with. It's therefore a shame that much of this is not explicitly taught. This beginner-level talk explains the web, how it was designed, what it was meant to be, and how we got where we are.
