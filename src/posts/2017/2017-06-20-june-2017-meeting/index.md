**Topic**

Speaker: Jess Planck Topic: 10 Years of Using WordPress at Nicholls

I’ll briefly discuss how things got started from a single testing site and progressed to the current single and multisite WordPress deployment used today. I’ll outline the reasoning, history, and evolution that has lead our team to focus on using WordPress in a collaborative environment to meet the needs of our multifaceted audience. Some parts also include leadership “buy-in”, training, support, and continual maintenance. I plan to allow plenty of time for questions.
