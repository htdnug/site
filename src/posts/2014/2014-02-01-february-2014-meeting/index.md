I got asked a question recently that got me thinking about this month's topic. We're going to be looking at ways to refactor legacy code. We'll start with the data layer so expect to see a lot of ADO. We'll also be discussing the best practices for ADO usage.

I'll try and have the legacy code that we'll start with on CodePlex before the meeting so everyone can review it if they want.
